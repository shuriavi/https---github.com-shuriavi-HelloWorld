# Overview
I was able to complete a program that subtracts a stop time from a start time. I used Kotlin as the language and could be the beginning of a laps function on a stopwatch.

I wrote this project to be able to subtract a start and a stop time because I always wonder how much time I am actually working on assigments without breaks.

# Development Environment

I used a kotlin playground to run my program but mostly wrote my code in vs code.
